# Parent Positions

We are a __Parent Participation School__ and parent volunteers are essential to the running of our school. The Parent Volunteer Positions are determined by the Board of Directors. These may be subject to change, because the programs offered to the children are directly tied to the skills and interest of the parents, it is possible that you have a different way to participate. Please contact the Parent Participation Director with your ideas. 

The committee positions are offered on a first-come, first-filled basis. Those parents who have not yet signed up for a position before the September Parent Meeting will be required to do so before the end of that meeting.
