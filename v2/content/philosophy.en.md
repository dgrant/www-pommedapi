# Our Philosophy

* To help make our children’s first experience of “school” as enjoyable as possible.
* To introduce our children to the French language as naturally as possible.
* To provide a stimulating and friendly environment in which they may find delight in exploring the fascinating world around them.
* To explore topical themes with songs, games, puppet plays, creative activities, outings, and invited guests.
