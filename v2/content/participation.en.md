# Parent participation

We are an organization run entirely by parents. In order to offer enriched programming, varied activities, and administration for the school, we call upon you, the parents, to contribute to your child's first school experience.

When you enroll your child in the preschool you agree to participate in running the school. The success of the preschool depends upon the direct participation of everyone in our preschool community. 

In order to keep enrollment fees low, parent participation is a necessity. As a parent-run school, our secondary goal is to draw from the talent pool among the parents to administer the school and to organize events that directly impact the children in the classroom and during after-class activities. Each family is required to contribute to the running of the school and to attend all General Meetings. 

See the [Board Positions](board.html) and [Committees](positions.html) lists for a brief description of the current positions available as determined by the Board of Directors.
