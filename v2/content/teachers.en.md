# Our Teachers

Pomme d'Api has an excellent staff of highly qualified Early Childhood Educators. There is a maximum ratio of 1 teacher for 10 kids, for a maximum of 20 children in each class with 2 teachers present at all times.

In addition to their ECE licenses, they are certified in First Aid and CPR, and Pomme d'Api encourages continuing education for the teachers to keep their knowledge of early childhood education up to date.
