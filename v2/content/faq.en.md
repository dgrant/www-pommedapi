# FAQ

__Q. What does Parent-Run mean?__

Pomme d'Api is a non-profit, parent-run preschool. Each family is required to contribute an average of four hours per month as well as attending our two parent meetings each year.  This contribution enables us to keep our tuition fees as low as possible, while fostering a sense of community within the school.  We fully believe that our teachers are entrusted to teach our children. We let them use their guidance and expertise to teach our children, while we run the rest of the school.  This way the teachers' main focus is always on our children.

__Q. What is Pomme d'Api's philosophy?__

* To help make our children's first experience at "school" as enjoyable as possible.
* To introduce them to the French language as naturally as possible.
* To reinforce first language learning opportunities for Francophone children.
* To provide a stimulating and friendly environment in which they may find delight in exploring the fascinating world around them.
* To explore topical themes with songs, games, puppet plays, creative activities, outings and invited guests.

__Q. What qualifications do the teachers have?__

Both teachers have completed their Early Childhood Education diploma (ECE Registry), as well they both hold current First Aid and CPR certificates.  Combined they have 9+ years at Pomme d'Api.

__Q. How long is the wait list?__

Our wait list varies from year to year.  There are generally students on the wait list, but spaces do become available throughout the year, so we encourage all parents to contact us at any time. Registration begins at our Open House.  For the 2013/2014 school year the Open House is on Saturday, February 22, 2014 from at 9:00AM to 12:00PM.

__Q. I want to observe the classroom, how do I do that?__

Please feel free to email us at {%registrar_email_link%} or by calling the school at {%telephone_number%}. The teachers will help find a time that is mutually agreeable.

__Q. Does the school serve snacks?__

No, the school does not provide the children with snacks.  There is a snack time each day, but each family is responsible for packing a healthy snack and drink for their child.  On special occasions the class will have a combined snack where each child is encouraged to contribute to a shared snack.  Pomme d'Api is a nut aware school.  We are considerate of those who have allergies and ask that no nuts be brought for snacks.

__Q. Are the snacks peanut-free?__

Yes, please see above. Pomme d'Api is nut aware.

__Q. Is there anything other than a snack that I should send with my child?__

Every child needs a pair of indoor shoes as well as a spare set of clothing. Even though children are toilet trained, they are asked to have a spare set of underwear as accidents are not uncommon, especially in the first couple of months with the excitement of a new school and routine. 

__Q. Is there playground/outdoor time?__

Yes. Pomme d'Api has a wonderful fully-fenced green space outside of the classroom. Children are asked to be prepared to go outside each day. You will often see the children, running and having fun, on any non-rainy day. There are many toys and activities for all the children to partake in while on our playground.

__Q. Are there field trips?__

Yes, there are field-trips and in-school presentations that are spearheaded by the teachers and organized by the parents. Field trips change from year to year, but in the past few years the field trips / in school presentations have included: a Pumpkin Patch, a scavenger hunt and picnic at Central Park, the Vancouver Art Gallery, the local fire station, Anne Hebert, Mike's Critters, an African drum ensemble and others.

__Q. Are there professional development days?__

The school generally does not close for Professional Days like elementary schools do. Our teachers are encouraged to participate in many professional development activities, as we believe it is important for them to stay as current as possible on the latest early childhood research and activities. Often this is done one at a time, so a substitute teacher will be with the remaining teacher for the day. Other times the professional development activities/ conferences are after school hours, and our teachers attend on their own time.

__Q. How long and when are the Christmas breaks and Spring breaks?__

Pomme d'Api has followed the Vancouver School Board's holiday schedule; however, for the past two years the VSB has been piloting an alternate schedule, which has given them a 2 week spring break. Pomme d'Api has taken the first of the two for the past two years. The Christmas break has continued to align exactly with the VSBs.

__Q. How are statutory holidays handled?__

The school is closed on all Statutory holidays.

Q__. How (or who) do parents communicate questions and concerns?__

Parents are encouraged to discuss issues with the teachers or any of the board members.

__Q. How does the school communicate with the parents?__

The teachers send out a monthly calendar / newsletter to keep the parents appraised of the happenings within the school. The Board minutes are emailed out to every family, as well as any volunteer areas that need to be filled. This email is called the devoirs.

__Q. Is there gradual entry for new students?__

There is a gradual entry, which varies from class to class. This transition helps the children immensely in getting used to their new school/ getting back into the school routine as well well as adjusting to their peers. The full schedule will be sent to each family with the times/ dates that are specific to your child in a summer mail-out.

__Q. What should I bring for my child on the first day of school?__

On the first day of school the younger students will not need snacks (you will be informed when this needs to occur). The older kids will need to resume bringing snacks that first week back to school. Also, the teachers ask that each student brings a pair of inside shoes and a change of clothes (to be kept in their cubby).

__Q. Are there books or CDs I can buy to introduce the French language at home?__

Yes, we have a song book and CD created by a Pomme d'Api teacher. This book includes many of the songs and vocabulary used each season within the school. We also have an excellent bi-lingual game that reinforces French vocabulary in a fun and interactive way. This is a wonderful addition to any family considering French Immersion in Elementary School.  It is supplied by CPF (Canadian Parents for French). Please see either teacher to purchase.

__Q. What if my child is not fully potty-trained before starting school in September?__

Your child needs to be potty-trained - the teachers do not change diapers; however, as mentioned above, accidents happen, and the teachers will help a child change if necessary. Some children wear "pull-ups" as backup protection for those first few weeks of school.
