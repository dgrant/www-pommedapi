# Registration & Fees

We are still accepting applications for the 2013/2014 school year. We have very limited amount of space left in some of our classes (3 day Immersion and Francophone). __Call us today!__

Pomme d'Api Registration for each new school year begins at the annual Open House. The Open House for the 2014/2015 school year will be held February 22, 2014 from 9am to 12pm.  Our Open House is where we begin accepting applications for all classes.

The Registration/Application Form may be filled out in advance.

Registration is on a first-come, first serve basis. However, priority is given, in order, to:

1. Returning students
2. Siblings of students (including students previously registered at Pomme d'Api)
3. General registration

If you have any questions regarding registration, please feel free to email us at {%registrar_email_link%} or by calling the school at {%telephone_number%}.

Please provide the following information:

* Your child's full name
* Your name, phone number, and email address
* Your child's date of birth
* The class(es) that you would like to enroll in.

The registrar will let you know if there are spaces available. If spaces are available, you will be requested to complete the registration form and provide tuition deposit and a non-refundable registration fee ({%registration_fee%}), in order to secure your spot.

If classes are full, we encourage you to place your child on the waitlist, at no charge. Once a space becomes available, families on the waitlist are called in priority order and offered the opportunity to register.

2 Day students may still register once school starts, space permitting up until December 1st (February 1st for the 3 & 4 day programs). _The Board may approve a registration beyond the December 1st deadline. This will be determined on a case by case basis with the approval of the teachers._
