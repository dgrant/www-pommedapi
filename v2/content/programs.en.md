# Our Programs

Pré-Maternelle Pomme d’Api offers preschool education for children to help foster their social and cognitive development, while teaching and encouraging the use of the French language. Our goal is to make our children’s first school experience as enjoyable as possible. Our programs provide a stimulating and friendly environment in which children may find delight in exploring the fascinating world around them!

Our policy is to promote cooperation, support autonomy and encourage development of each child’s unique self-expression. We recognize that limits must be set and reinforced; if necessary we use diversion. Our goal is to shape behavior in a positive and educational manner. We help children learn how to share, encourage them to express their feelings, promote group participation, and emphasize consideration for others and respect for individuals.

French is introduced as naturally as possible, through the two language programs: French Immersion and Programme Francophone.

For the language portion of Pomme d’Api’s preschool program, the purpose of the French Immersion program is to teach French to non-French speaking children. The purpose of the Francophone program is to reinforce the language and to develop a vocabulary with children who already understand French.
