# Program descriptions

Pomme d’Api offers four different programs – two immersion programs and two francophone
programs. The two immersion programs are completely separate from each other, but the two
francophone programs overlap each other and are generally treated as a single class with the
older students coming for an extra day each week.

## Two-day immersion program

The two-day immersion program is aimed at children entering their first year of preschool.
Most of the children will be 32-48 months of age, and activities and language are geared to that
developmental level. French is introduced, but English is used as necessary.

## Three-day immersion program

The three-day immersion program is aimed at children progressing from the two-day
immersion program, as well as new students who are at least 4 years old by December 31 of
the year they start the program. The use of French in the classroom increases throughout the
year.

## Three-day francophone program

The three-day francophone program is aimed at children aged 3-5 from francophone families.
This program is conducted exclusively in French.

## Four-day francophone program

The four-day francophone program is aimed at children aged 4-5 from francophone families.
This program overlaps with the three-day francophone program, but has one extra class each
week. The additional day allows the teachers to pursue more age-appropriate activities with
the older children that are unsuitable for the younger students.
