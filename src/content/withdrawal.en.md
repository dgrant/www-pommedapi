# Withdrawal

There is a six-week probationary period for new students at Pomme d’Api. If you withdraw your
child from Pomme d’Api during this period, your tuition deposit for the month of June will be
refunded.

If you choose to withdraw your child after the probationary period is over, you must notify the
Registrar in writing one month prior to withdrawal. If you give written notice at least one
month in advance, your tuition deposit for the month of June will be refunded. Otherwise, it
will be forfeited.

The six-week probationary period only applies to new students, not to returning
students.

This means that returning students must follow the regular withdrawal procedure (give one
month’s written notice in order to receive a refund of the tuition deposit), even if they wish to
withdraw during the first six weeks of the school year.
