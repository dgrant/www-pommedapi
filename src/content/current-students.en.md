# Absences

If your child will be absent from preschool, please send a text to our text-only absentee line at
{% absentee_text_number %} with a message in the following format:

Child’s name  
Class  
Your name

This will let the teachers know not to expect your child. This phone number is a _text-only
absentee line_. Please do not add any extra information. You will not receive a confirmation
text, but your text program should tell you when your text has been received.

If you aren’t able to send texts, or need to give the teachers more information (such as
informing them of a contagious illness) you may also call the school at {% telephone_number %} to speak
to one of the teachers or leave a voicemail.
