# Health Issues

There are a number of health issues that can affect your child and his or her classmates during
their time at the preschool.

## Toilet training

We require students to be toilet trained when they start at the preschool. If your child is
mostly toilet trained, but prone to accidents, you may wish to have them wear pull-ups during
the first few weeks.

All children should have a complete change of clothing in their cubby in case of accidents, even
if they are fully toilet trained.

## Clothing

Your child will need a pair of indoor shoes, to be kept in his or her cubby at the preschool. The
shoes should be clearly marked with your child’s name.

The teachers take the children outside throughout the year (weather permitting), so please
send your child to preschool with appropriate indoor and outdoor clothing. For example, at
different times of year, children may need boots, a winter coat, a winter hat, mittens, rain gear,
or sunscreen.

## Snack

Please provide a healthy, nutritious snack for your child. Water is always available in the class,
but many children bring a water bottle as well. The teachers integrate nutrition into the
curriculum so it is important that you do not send “junk food.”

There are __no nuts__ allowed at Pomme d’Api. This includes peanut butter and Nutella.
If your child’s classmates have other severe food allergies, you may be asked not to bring
certain other foods as well.

If it is your child’s birthday, he or she may bring a treat for the class. Please speak to the
teachers in advance.

## Immunization

You must provide the preschool with a photocopy of your child’s immunization record.
Immunizations should be up to date.

If your child’s immunizations are not up to date, you must inform the preschool in writing. This
information will be forwarded to Vancouver Coastal Health. If there is an outbreak of an
immunizable disease for which your child is not immunized, the Health Department will notify
the preschool, and your child will not be allowed to attend classes until the city’s Medical
Health Officer deems it safe for the child to return.

## Medication

If it is necessary for the teachers to give your child medication (prescription or non-prescription)
while he or she is at preschool, you must complete the form called _Permission to Administer
Medication_, which is included in the summer information package and can also be obtained
from the teachers.
