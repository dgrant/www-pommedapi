# Basic method for teaching French

## Step one - establishing trust

At the beginning of the school year, we concentrate on welcoming the children as individuals
and establishing a solid foundation of trust and friendship. French is introduced very gradually,
with the exception of the Francophone program where French is spoken from the beginning.

## Step two - increasing the use of French

Once the children feel comfortable in the preschool setting, we increase the use of French and
decrease the use of English, with the ultimate goal of English being used only when dealing with
matters of safety or discipline. The language is kept simple yet challenging, and is adapted
according to the maturity of the children.

The teachers do not point out language mistakes, because correcting the children would
discourage many of them and hinder their spontaneity. Instead, the teachers rephrase the
children's statements in a supportive and positive manner. For example:

> Child: _Yesterday I seed a dog in the park._  
> Teacher: _Oh, you saw a dog in the park yesterday!_

Children need both structure and flexibility in order to develop a positive attitude towards the
French language and culture. Therefore, we provide structure, but it remains flexible based on
the children's needs, language levels, and learning styles.
