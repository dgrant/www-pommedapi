# Sickness and communicable diseases

If your child is sick, or is contagious with a communicable disease, he or she must stay home.
Please inform the teachers if your child is sick, so that they know not to expect him or her, and
also so that they can notify the other parents if necessary.

In many cases we can take group action to prevent the further spread of contagious illnesses. If
necessary, we will consult medical professionals for advice which we will then pass on to all
parents.

# Guidelines to determine if your child is well enough to attend preschool

The following guidelines will help you to assess whether your child is well enough to attend
preschool. Please remember that your actions will have an impact on the rest of the group. In
the best interest of all of our students and teachers, please keep your child home if he or she is
ill.

## Vomiting and diarrhea

If your child has been vomiting or has had diarrhea, he or she must not attend preschool for at
least 24 hours after the symptoms have subsided.

## Communicable diseases

If your child has a communicable disease such as chicken pox, measles, scarlet fever, mumps, or
conjunctivitis (pinkeye), he or she must stay home, and you must inform the preschool so that
we can notify other parents that their children may have been exposed. Your child may return
once the incubation and contagious period has passed.

## Mucous and Coughing

If your child has a clear runny nose and light coughing, but no other symptoms, he or she may
attend preschool.

If your child has cloudy or green mucous or a very bad cough, he or she should stay home to
avoid infecting others, unless you have a doctor's note indicating that your child is not
contagious.

## Fever

If your child has a fever, he or she must not attend preschool until 24 hours after the fever is
gone.
