# Dual enrollment

Because Pomme d’Api offers only part-time programs, some parents may choose to enroll their
children in additional programs.

We do not restrict dual enrollment, but we strongly advise that you do not start both programs
at the same time. It can be very stressful for children to start preschools and daycares, and it is
important that you monitor how your child is adjusting to both programs. This situation will not
work for all children, and if you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to discuss them with
the teaching staff.

If it becomes obvious that a child is not adapting after a reasonable amount of time, parents
and teachers may choose to withdraw the child from one program until he or she is better
prepared for an additional preschool experience.

If you do choose to have your child in an additional program, we remind you that all child care
programs differ in philosophies, teaching methodologies, and staff personalities. As Pomme
d’Api is one of the few preschools offering French Immersion and a Francophone program, the
delivery of its programs will differ from that of other programs not specializing in language
acquisition.
