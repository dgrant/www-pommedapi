# What to do if you have a concern or a complaint

We encourage parents to raise their concerns and take a problem-solving approach to resolving
conflicts. In addition, we respect the confidentiality of all parents.

If you have a concern about your child’s progress, please make an appointment with the
teachers. While it is tempting to engage the teachers in conversation during drop-off and pick-up,
our children need their attention at this time!

Teachers will set aside time for parent-teacher conferences whenever requested. Please do not
attempt to discuss your concerns with the teachers while class is in session.

If you have a complaint about any aspect of the preschool, including the administration or the
teachers, please contact the President or Vice President. We have established procedures for
dealing with complaints and grievances, and will attempt to resolve conflicts objectively,
quickly, and confidentially. For more information on these procedures, please refer to Pomme
d’Api’s Policy Manual.
