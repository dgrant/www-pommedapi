# Introduction

Pomme d’Api is a parent run preschool. Our success depends on the support and
corporation of all parents.

This manual explains the duties of each volunteer role. It is important that you check
this manual to understand what the duties of your assigned role are. If you want to learn
more about our general parent participation policies please consult the Parent Guide,
available on our website.

* Please note that some roles require you to volunteer either before or after the school
year has begun and ended and some roles require more volunteering at certain times
of year or at special events.

* Some volunteer roles are very specific (for instance Classroom Cleaners), others are
part of committees (for instance the Grant Writing Committee) that are largely selfdriven.
It is up to the committee members to decide which specific projects and tasks
they undertake throughout the year.

* As a parent volunteer it will be helpful for you to get in touch with the parent who occupied
your volunteer role last year in the beginning of the school year to learn about
your role. You can obtain the contact information for your predecessor from the Parent
Participation Director at {% participationEmailLink %}.

* If you have any questions about your role that are not answered in this manual,
please contact the Parent Participation Director.
