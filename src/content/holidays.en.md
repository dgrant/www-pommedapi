# Holidays and school closure

The preschool is closed on all statutory holidays. In addition, there is a two-week Christmas
Break and a one-week Spring Break. Our Christmas Break coincides with the Vancouver School
Board’s Winter Break. Our Spring Break coincides with the second week of the Vancouver School
Board’s two-week Spring Break. The Secretary will send out a list of school closure dates for the
current year shortly after the preschool opens in September.

* Thanksgiving
* Remembrance Day
* Christmas (two-week vacation)
* Family Day
* Spring Break (one-week vacation)
