# Absences

If your child will be absent from preschool, please send a text to our __text-only absentee line__ at
{% absenteeTextNumber %} with a message in the following format:

> Child’s name  
> Class  
> Parent name

This will let the teachers know not to expect your child. This phone number is a __text-only__
absentee line. Please do not add any extra information. You will not receive a confirmation
text, but your text program should tell you when your text has been received.

If you aren’t able to send texts, or need to give the teachers more information (such as
informing them of a contagious illness) you may also call the school at {% telephoneNumber %} to speak
to one of the teachers or leave a voicemail.

If you know in advance that your child will be missing one or more classes, please inform the
teachers in advance.

Keeping the teachers informed of when your child will be absent will help to
maintain accurate records of attendance in case of emergency.

No refunds or pro-rated fees will be given for missed classes or for temporary long-term
absences, such as extended vacations. This includes families who extend summer vacations into
September.

# Sickness and communicable diseases

If your child is sick, or is contagious with a communicable disease, he or she must stay home.
Please inform the teachers if your child is sick, so that they know not to expect him or her, and
also so that they can notify the other parents if necessary.

In many cases we can take group action to prevent the further spread of contagious illnesses. If
necessary, we will consult medical professionals for advice which we will then pass on to all
parents.

# Guidelines to determine if your child is well enough to attend preschool

The following guidelines will help you to assess whether your child is well enough to attend
preschool. Please remember that your actions will have an impact on the rest of the group. In
the best interest of all of our students and teachers, please keep your child home if he or she is
ill.

## Vomiting and diarrhea

If your child has been vomiting or has had diarrhea, he or she must not attend preschool for at
least 24 hours after the symptoms have subsided.

## Communicable diseases

If your child has a communicable disease such as chicken pox, measles, scarlet fever, mumps, or
conjunctivitis (pinkeye), he or she must stay home, and you must inform the preschool so that
we can notify other parents that their children may have been exposed. Your child may return
once the incubation and contagious period has passed.

## Mucous and Coughing

If your child has a clear runny nose and light coughing, but no other symptoms, he or she may
attend preschool.

If your child has cloudy or green mucous or a very bad cough, he or she should stay home to
avoid infecting others, unless you have a doctor's note indicating that your child is not
contagious.

## Fever

If your child has a fever, he or she must not attend preschool until 24 hours after the fever is
gone.
