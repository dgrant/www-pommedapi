# Who can attend events at Pomme d’Api?

Pomme d’Api’s insurance policy covers enrolled students and their immediate families. This
means that we cannot allow unrelated children to attend events at the school.

Siblings of registered students are welcome to attend in-classroom events such as class
potlucks. Children who are not registered students or siblings of registered students cannot
attend in-classroom events.

The only exception is our annual Open House, which is held outside of regular classroom hours
and is open to the public.

Children who are not registered students or siblings of registered students may attend field
trips under some circumstances, because they are not held on school property and the children
remain under the supervision of the adult they arrived with.

If you would like to bring a child who is not a student or sibling of a student along on a field trip,
please speak to the teachers and the field trip rep ahead of time.
