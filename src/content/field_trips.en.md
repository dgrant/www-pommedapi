# Field trips

Each class at Pomme d’Api will have several field trips over the course of the year. For most
field trips, parents must transport their own children and remain present throughout the field
trip.

Occasionally there may be a field trip where some parent volunteers are required, but not all
parents need to stay with their children (for example, a walk to a nearby park or fire hall).

In all cases, information about the field trip, including permission slips and fees, will be handed
out in advance. Each student must have a signed permission slip to attend a field trip, even if
his or her parent or guardian is present.
