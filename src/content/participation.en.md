# Parent Participation

Pomme d’Api is a parent-run preschool. As such, families are required to participate in three
ways:

1. At least one parent from each family must attend general parent meetings.
2. All families must participate in fundraising activities.
3. At least one parent from each family must volunteer their time for the operation and
administration of the preschool.

The school was set up this way to ensure the best experience for our children; to facilitate
communication between parents, teachers, and the executive Board; and to maintain a low fee
structure.

## Parent meetings

The school holds two general parent meetings each year: the spring meeting for new and
returning parents in May and the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in September. At least one
parent from each family is required to attend each of these meetings.

These meetings are an opportunity for parents to clarify issues with the Board and the teachers,
and for the Board and the teachers to inform parents of the latest news and consult them on
upcoming events, volunteer opportunities, or issues the school may be facing. At the AGM, the
Board for the upcoming school year is also elected.

The dates of the meetings are posted well in advance, and child care is available during the
meetings. If nobody from your family can attend due to extraordinary circumstances, please
contact one of the Board members.

## Fundraising activities

Although there is a volunteer committee in charge of fundraising, all families are also expected
to participate during our annual fundraisers. Our major fundraiser usually happens at the
Christmas concert, with a gift basket draw.

## Volunteering

Parents are required to volunteer their time throughout the year. Pomme d’Api’s success
depends on the support and cooperation of all parents.

We do not belong to the Council of Parent Participation Preschools, and do not require “duty”
parents to help in the classroom. However, we do require parents to hold a designated
volunteer position, either on the elected Board or in a non-elected volunteer position.

Please be sure that you have filled out a Parent Participation Contract, available at the spring
parent meeting or from the Parent Participation Director. This will ensure that you are placed in
a position that matches your skills and interests.

The volunteer Board members are officially elected at the AGM in September. All other
positions will be filled early in the school year.

Other, less predictable, volunteer opportunities will come up over the course of the year, and
will be announced in a monthly email called “Devoirs.” Occasionally a very urgent volunteer
need will arise, in which case the Parent Participation Director will send out a special email to
all parents.

### Volunteer hours

Every family must contribute an average of 3 to 4 volunteer hours per month, or 30 to 40 hours
over the course of the school year.

Each month, you will be asked to submit your volunteer hours to your class representative, who
will tally them and report them to the Parent Participation Director. It is not expected that
every family will contribute 3 to 4 hours every month, but rather that by the end of the year
their total volunteer contribution will be between 30 and 40 hours. We understand that some
volunteer positions require significant effort and hours in concentrated periods of time (for
example, Christmas Concert volunteers, or the Open House committee).

### Non-Participation policy

When you register your child at Pomme d’Api, you must include a deposit cheque of {% noParticipationPenalty %},
dated for July 1 of the following year. This cheque will be destroyed if your family contributes at
least {% minimumParticipationHours %} volunteer hours by June 30. If you do not meet this minimum requirement by June 30,
the cheque will be cashed.

Any family who has contributed less than 15 hours of volunteer time by December 31 will
receive an email notification during the first week of preschool in January. This notification will:

* ask the family to report any outstanding volunteer hours that may have occurred but
not been reported to the class representative
* remind the family of the volunteer policy and requirements
* ask the family to make efforts to volunteer in the coming months (acknowledging that if
they are on the Open House committee their hours will likely increase naturally in the
coming months)

Any family who has contributed less than 20 hours of volunteer time by April 1 will receive a
warning that their deposit will be lost if they do not reach {% minimumParticipationHours %} hours by the end of the school
year.

The Board will review the list of families with outstanding volunteer requirements at the June
Board meeting, and cheques will be cashed the first business day following July 1 for those
families that did not meet the requirement.

If at any point you need help finding volunteer work, please contact the Parent Participation
Director.
