# Drop-offs and Pick-ups

Pomme d’Api has a number of policies and procedures regarding drop-offs and pick-ups,
including our request that parents allow extra time for the two day immersion class drop-off
and pick-up, our gates-closed policy, our sign-in/sign-out procedure, our Safe Release
procedure, and our policy about late pick-ups.

## Gates-closed policy

Please close both gates behind you as you enter and exit the church yard and the school yard
on your way in and out of the preschool. These gates must be kept closed and latched at all
times so that the children are safe while playing in the school yard, both during class time and
before and after school.

## Sign-in/sign-out procedure

When you drop your child off at the preschool, you must sign him or her in by entering your
child’s name, the time, and your signature on the day’s sign-in/sign-out sheet. The sign-in/sign-out
sheet is kept on a table near the front door.

When you pick your child up, you must sign him or her out, by filling out the pick-up time and
your signature on the sign-in/sign-out sheet. If the children are outside in the school yard at the
time of pick-up, the teachers will have the sign-in/sign-out sheet outside as well.

<!--infoBox-->
It is very important to sign your child in and out every day, so that the teachers
know which children are under their care at all times. This is particularly important in case of an
emergency situation.

## Safe Release procedure

The teachers will follow Pomme d’Api’s Safe Release procedure when releasing your child after
class is over. This procedure details who may pick your child up, and under what circumstances
teachers may refuse to release your child.

## Authorized pick-up

The teachers will not release your child to someone you have not authorized. This is the
procedure you must follow to authorize somebody to pick up your child:

1. During the first week of class, parents must fill out a form listing the names of all
persons who are permitted to pick up their child.
2. If somebody not already on the authorized list will be picking up your child, you must
notify the school and teachers in writing.
3. In a rare emergency situation, written notice can be made at the last minute via email.  
_Note:_ Notice cannot be given by phone. The school must have a written record.
4. If the person picking up the child is not known to the teachers, information about the
person must be provided, including the following: name, phone number, and physical
description. This person will be required to show photo ID.  
_Note:_ This includes people who are on the authorized list but that the teachers have not
yet met.

## Unauthorized pick-up

If an unauthorized person arrives to pick up a child, the following procedure will be followed:

1. The child will remain under the supervision of the teacher at the preschool.
2. The teacher will speak to the individual and explain the policy that no child will be
released without written authorization from the parent or guardian.
3. The parent or guardian will be contacted.
4. If difficulties arise, all reasonable efforts will be made to ensure the safety of the child
and of the other children. If necessary the police will be called for assistance.

## Alleged impaired pickup

The teachers at Pomme d’Api will not release a child to an authorized person who is unable to
adequately care for the child. The teachers will offer to call a relative or friend to pick up the
person and child.

If the person is driving a vehicle, the teacher will explain that driving under the influence of
drugs or alcohol is against the law and that the teacher is obligated to ensure the safety of the
child. If this person chooses to get in the car (with or without the child) the teacher will
immediately notify police and provide a description of the car and direction/location headed. If
the teacher believes that the child is in need of protection, the Ministry of Children and Family
Development will be notified.

## Custody and related court orders

If a custody or court order exists, a copy of the order must be placed in the child’s file at
Pomme d’Api preschool. The guardian is responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date
information concerning the legal guardianship of the child.

Without a custody or court order on file, the teachers cannot deny access to the non-enrolling
parent.

## Late pick-ups

It is your responsibility to pick up your child on time at the end of each class. In an emergency,
you must make arrangements to have somebody else pick up your child.

<!--infoBox-->
The teachers are authorized to release your child only to those people you have
designated on your registration form.

If you know that there will be a change in pick-up routine, please tell the teachers ahead of
time. In an emergency, please phone the school at {% telephoneNumber %} to inform the teachers of the
change in pick-up plans.

If a parent or other designated adult has not arrived to pick up a child 15 minutes after the
scheduled class ending time, the teachers will attempt to contact the child’s parent(s). If a
parent cannot be reached, the teachers will then attempt to contact the child’s emergency
contacts.

At the discretion of the teachers:

* The first time this situation occurs there will be no penalty.
* If this situation occurs a second time, a written warning will be issued.
* If this situation occurs a third time, the parent will be required to meet
with two members of the Board to discuss the issue, and will incur a {% latePickupPenalty %} penalty.

If no resolution can be reached, the parent will be asked to withdraw their child from the
preschool. This penalty may seem harsh, but late pick-ups infringe upon the teacher’s time,
affect the child’s self-esteem, and violate licensing regulations if the child is left for too long
after his or her class ends.
