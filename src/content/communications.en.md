# Communication

Most communication between parents and the school is done by email. This is why you are
asked to provide the school with an email address that you check at least once per week.

Some communication also happens via notices left in the students’ cubbies in the cloakroom.
You, or the person who picks up your child, should regularly check your child’s cubby for any
notices. The cubbies also often contain art projects which have been on display but have been
taken down and are ready to go home with the students.

In emergencies or situations that require communication on short notice (such as school
closures due to bad weather), we will contact you using the phone/text tree notification
procedure discussed in the General Emergency Procedures section.
