# Discipline

We believe that discipline must be appropriate for the age and developmental level of the child.
Our policy is to promote cooperation, support autonomy, and encourage the development of
each child’s unique self-expression.

We recognize that limits must be set and reinforced, and our goal is to shape behavior in a
positive and educational manner. We help children learn to share, we encourage them to
express their feelings, and we use diversion when necessary.

Where there is concern about a child’s behavior, the teachers will follow a process that includes
meeting with the child’s parent or guardian for problem solving and, if required, consulting with
external resources. Please refer to Pomme d’Api’s Policy Manual for specific details on this
process.
