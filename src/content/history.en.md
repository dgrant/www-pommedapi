# History of Pr√©maternelle Pomme d'Api

In 1983, a group of parents decided to establish a preschool where children could be
introduced to the French language naturally through creative play. They formed the East Side
French Preschool Society, and began by offering immersion programs only.

In 1994, the East Side French Preschool added a francophone program designed for children of
French-speaking parents, and legally changed its name to Pomme d'Api. Pomme d'Api refers to
a type of red apple, and is used as a metaphor referring to children having cheeks as red as this
apple.
