# Absences

If your child will be absent from preschool, please send a text to our __text-only absentee line__ at
{% absenteeTextNumber %} with a message in the following format:

> Child’s name  
> Class  
> Parent name

This will let the teachers know not to expect your child. This phone number is a __text-only__
absentee line. Please do not add any extra information. You will not receive a confirmation
text, but your text program should tell you when your text has been received.

If you aren’t able to send texts, or need to give the teachers more information (such as
informing them of a contagious illness) you may also call the school at {% telephoneNumber %} to speak
to one of the teachers or leave a voicemail.

If you know in advance that your child will be missing one or more classes, please inform the
teachers in advance.

Keeping the teachers informed of when your child will be absent will help to
maintain accurate records of attendance in case of emergency.

No refunds or pro-rated fees will be given for missed classes or for temporary long-term
absences, such as extended vacations. This includes families who extend summer vacations into
September.
