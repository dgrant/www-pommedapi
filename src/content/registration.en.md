# Registration

Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis. However, priority is given in the following
order:

1. Returning students
2. Siblings of current students and siblings of previous students
3. General registration

If you are informed that there is a space for your child, complete and return the registration
form along with a tuition deposit of one month’s tuition and a non-refundable registration fee
of {%registrationFee%}. This will ensure that your child’s space is reserved for him/her.

If there are no spaces available, you have the option to put your child’s name on the wait
list. Those on the waiting list are not required to submit the registration fee or tuition deposit
until a space has become available.

Most students start at the preschool at the beginning of the school year in September, but
students may enter the two-day immersion class until December 1, and the three-day
immersion and both francophone classes until February 1, if space is available.
The Board may occasionally approve a registration beyond the deadline, determined on a case-by-case
basis with the approval of the teachers.

If you have any questions regarding registration, please feel free to email us at
