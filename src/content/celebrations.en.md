# Celebrations and special days

Pomme d’Api holds an annual Christmas concert and party in mid-December (usually on the
evening of the last day of classes before the Christmas break) in the church next to the school.
Each class will perform a selection of songs.

For students who are moving on to Kindergarten, a graduation ceremony is held during class
time on the last day of classes in June. Families are welcome to attend. The two-day immersion
class will have an end-of-year party instead, also with families invited.

In addition, there are a number of fun days that are held during classes, such as a Halloween
party, a pajama day, and various cultural celebrations. You will be informed of these in advance
if there is anything special your child should bring or wear.

You are welcome to bring a treat for the class on your child’s birthday, but please speak to the
teachers ahead of time so that they are prepared.

If you have a cultural celebration that you would like to share with your child’s class, please
speak with the teachers to make arrangements. They are always happy to incorporate their
students’ cultural backgrounds into the curriculum.
