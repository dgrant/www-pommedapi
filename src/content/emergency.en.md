# Accident and Emergency Procedures

This section talks about our procedures for accidents or other emergencies which may occur
while your child is at the preschool.

## Accident Procedures

On the first day of school you will be asked to fill out three Emergency Consent cards which
include emergency contact information for your child. Please ensure that you leave a number
where you or another designated caregiver can be reached quickly.

For accidents requiring first aid, you or your child’s designated caregiver may be called to come
to the preschool.

For more serious injuries, you or your child’s designated caregiver may be asked to bring your
child to the emergency department of Children’s Hospital. If your child’s emergency contact
cannot be reached or cannot come to the preschool immediately, another responsible adult will
accompany your child to Children’s Hospital.

All deep cuts and head injuries will be taken seriously and will require examination by hospital
staff.

When you collect your child after an accident, once the child is out of danger, you will be given
an official description of the accident, as witnessed by another adult. The teachers will also file
an accident report in accordance with Vancouver Health Department regulations.

## General Emergency Procedures

This is a summary of Pomme d’Api’s Emergency Plan. Please refer to Pomme d’Api’s Policy
Manual for more details.

### Phone/text tree

At the beginning of the school year, your class representative will ask you for the phone
number where you are mostly likely to be reached. If possible, you should be able to receive
texts at this number. If you cannot receive texts, please notify your class rep when you give him
or her the phone number.

The class rep will create a contact list so that he or she can text all of the parents in the class at
once. (If there are any parents in the class who cannot receive texts, the class rep will have a
note of that, along with those parents’ phone numbers.)

The President will also have this contact information, with a contact list for each class.

If there is an emergency, the class rep (or the President, if necessary) will follow this notification
procedure:

1. Send a group text to all of the parents in the class with information about the
emergency, requesting a return text to confirm the message was received.
2. Phone any parents who cannot receive texts, with the same information that was
included in the text.
3. Keep track of responses to the text. After a reasonable amount of time, any parent who
has not responded to the group text will be phoned.

This phone/text tree notification procedure will also be used in non-emergency situations that
require communication on short notice (such as school closures due to bad weather).

### Evacuation

If there is an emergency such as a fire or earthquake where the school must be evacuated,
students and teachers will move to a muster point in the empty lot at the back of the church
(on Gladstone just north of 44<sup>th</sup>, across the alley from the back door of the preschool).

In the event of an evacuation, parents will be contacted to come get their children. The
teachers will stay with the children until they are released to a parent or other designated
adult.

In the case of a prolonged emergency or if parents cannot be contacted, children may be
moved to a different location. In this case, a posted message will be left on the back door of the
preschool (a grey fire door facing the empty lot behind the church) with the location and
contact information for each child. If possible, parents will also be phoned, texted, or emailed
with the information.

### Emergency Kit and Emergency Comfort Kits

The preschool has an emergency kit with supplies for two teachers and 20 children for a three day period.

The preschool also stores a "personal comfort kit" for each child. At the beginning of the school year, you will be asked to bring in a large ziplock bag labelled with your child's name and filled with items that you feel would comfort your child in case they have to wait to be reunited with you in an emergency. For example, your kit could include:

* a short "letter of comfort" from you
* pictures (of your family, a pet, your child's room, etc.)
* a notepad or drawing paper
* small markers or pencil crayons
* a small stuffy, toy, playing cards, or a game
* a flashlight with batteries (flashlights are also included in the school's emergency kit)

The kit will also contain a copy of the emergency contact card you will be asked to fill out at the beginning of the school year.

The kits should not contain:

* food
* medication
* crayons (which can melt in the storage bin)
* items which would not fit in the ziplock bag
