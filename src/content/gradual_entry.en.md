# Gradual Entry

Gradual entry is a process meant to introduce your child to the new preschool environment in a
way that makes adjustment to the new routine easier, and reduces stress for both children and
parents.

Gradual entry will help you and your child to do the following:

* feel comfortable at the preschool
* begin to build a trusting relationship with the teachers
* have a positive start to the preschool experience
* feel confident about your child being left at the school without you

During gradual entry, we follow a series of steps in which parents gradually reduce the amount
of time their child sees them at the preschool. There are three steps, but these do not
necessarily happen over the course of three visits. Timing will vary between children, because
all children adapt differently. If, after the third visit, you are not sure where your child is in the
process, the teachers will help you decide how to proceed.

For some children, adapting to the new preschool environment can be very difficult. However,
sometimes having parents in the classroom for long periods of time can actually make
adjustment more difficult. If you are concerned about your child’s adaptation, or about the
gradual entry process, please speak with the teachers.

We also encourage you to read Coping with Separation Anxiety, a resource sheet that is
included in the summer information package which is emailed to parents well before classes
start.

There are three steps in our gradual entry process.

## First week

You should plan to stay for the first 15 minutes of class on your child’s first day of preschool
(parents of returning children can gauge, with the teachers’ help, whether this is necessary).

During the first week, you are encouraged to take short breaks away from the group. You may
wish to take short walks in the neighborhood, or remain in your car. You will continue to do this
until your child is ready for the next step. The teachers will help you to determine when your
child is ready.

## Next step

During this step, you will come into the preschool with your child and stay briefly, helping your
child to get involved in the activities. Once your child is settled, say goodbye and explain that
you are leaving and will be coming back when the class ends. This process should take no longer
than 5 minutes.

If, after a few days, your child still cries when you leave, you may feel uncomfortable about
leaving. However, the teachers are trained to deal with this situation, and are very good at
helping the children cope. (In fact, many children stop crying as soon as their parent is no
longer in sight.) Your children are in excellent hands, and your ability to leave will help the
adjustment process.

## Final step

During this step, you bring your child into the preschool. Once your child’s coat and snack are in
the cloakroom and they are wearing their indoor shoes, you sign them in, say goodbye, tell
them when you will pick them up, and leave. Your child will spend a normal day at the
preschool.

If, after the scheduled time of gradual entry is over, you or your child still needs extra support,
you can schedule a meeting with the teachers. They will help you to take the following steps:

* establish goals
* identify strategies to meet the goals
* set a timeline
* consider the possibility that your child might not be ready for preschool at this time

If you and the teachers agree that your child is not ready for preschool, you may withdraw your
child without submitting the one-month written notice, provided that it is within the six-week
probationary timeframe. You will be reimbursed for your tuition deposit and have your post-dated
cheques returned to you. We do require that you submit a written notice of withdrawal
for our records.
