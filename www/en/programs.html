<h1 id="program-descriptions">Program descriptions</h1>
<p>Pomme d’Api offers four different programs – two immersion programs and two francophone
programs. The two immersion programs are completely separate from each other, but the two
francophone programs overlap each other and are generally treated as a single class with the
older students coming for an extra day each week.</p>
<h2 id="two-day-immersion-program">Two-day immersion program</h2>
<p>The two-day immersion program is aimed at children entering their first year of preschool.
Most of the children will be 32-48 months of age, and activities and language are geared to that
developmental level. French is introduced, but English is used as necessary.</p>
<p>Children should be 3 years old on December 31 of the school year in which they are registered. If they are 4 years old by December 31, they must register in the three-day immersion program.</p>
<h2 id="three-day-immersion-program">Three-day immersion program</h2>
<p>The three-day immersion program is aimed at children progressing from the two-day
immersion program, as well as new students who are at least 4 years old by December 31 of
the year they start the program. The use of French in the classroom increases throughout the
year.</p>
<h2 id="three-day-francophone-program">Three-day francophone program</h2>
<p>The three-day francophone program is aimed at children aged 3-4 from francophone families. 
This program is conducted exclusively in French.</p>
<p>Children should be 3 years old on December 31 of the school year in which they are registered. If they are 4 years old by December 31, they must register in the four-day francophone program.</p>
<h2 id="four-day-francophone-program">Four-day francophone program</h2>
<p>The four-day francophone program is aimed at children aged 4-5 from francophone families. Children should be at least 4 years old on December 31 of the school year in which they are registered.</p>
<p>This program overlaps with the three-day francophone program, but has one extra class each
week. The additional day allows the teachers to pursue more age-appropriate activities, such as kindergarten readiness, with
the older children.</p>
