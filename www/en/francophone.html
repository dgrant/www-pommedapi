<h1 id="francophone-program">Francophone Program</h1>
<p>The teachers speak only French in the classroom, and children are encouraged to reply in French, to the degree that is comfortable for them. It is accepted that the children will often speak English to one another, or to the teachers. For many children, English is the natural language of their community, even if French is spoken at home, and they have not experienced the use of French in social situations. Through the Programme Francophone, they will begin to see a context for French, and will gain confidence speaking French.</p>
<p>For a child to thrive in this context, it is imperative that French be part of his everyday life. It is the responsibility of the families who enroll their children in the Programme Francophone to also speak French to their child outside the classroom, and to expose the child to a francophone environment outside Pomme d’Api. If French support is not provided at home, then enrollment in the French Immersion program is suggested.</p>
<p><strong>Programme Francophone 3-4 y. old (3 years old on Dec 31)</strong>
<strong>(M/W/F 1:00 – 3:30pm)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Programme Francophone 4-5 y. old (4 years old on Dec 31)</strong>
<strong>(M/W/Th/F 1:00 – 3:30pm)</strong></p>
<p>The Programme Francophone was established in September of 1994. It is designed for French speaking children and for children of French speaking parent(s).This program includes the Modèle de Francisation distributed by the Association of Francophone Parents to only 10 preschools throughout the whole province. </p>
<p>At Pomme d’Api, the Programme Francophone follows the same social and cognitive developmental curriculum as in the Immersion Program, entirely in French. The program is aimed at children who have at least one francophone parent at home or who has lived or been continuously exposed to French. (See the registration guidelines for qualifications). It is the presumption that children in this program will continue to Maternelle at a French Language elementary school.</p>
