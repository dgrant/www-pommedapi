<h2 id="two-day-immersion-program">Two-day immersion program</h2>
<p>Students in the two-day program must be at least 32 months of age, in order to comply with
child care licensing regulations. This also ensures that the school is able to provide age
appropriate activities, toys, and furnishings.</p>
<p>The two-day program is aimed at students 32-48 months of age. While there is no policy against
admitting older children, we recommend that parents enroll older children into the three-day
program to keep them with peers of their own age and developmental level.</p>
<h2 id="three-day-immersion-program">Three-day immersion program</h2>
<p>Students in the three-day program must be at least 4 years old by December 31 of the year they
start the program. This ensures that students in the program are at roughly the same
developmental stage and allows teachers to adapt activities to an older group.</p>
<p>Because this is a policy rather than a licensing requirement, the teachers may occasionally use
their discretion to allow a younger child to transfer from the two-day program into the three-day
program if they feel the child is mature enough. This is particularly relevant to children who
will turn four early in the new year.</p>
<h2 id="francophone-program">Francophone program</h2>
<p>Students in the francophone program must be at least 32 months of age. In addition, they must
meet at least one of the following three criteria from the Conseil scolaire francophone de la
C.B.:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one of the parents has French as a first language</li>
<li>At least one parent received his or her primary school instruction in French</li>
<li>A sibling has received or is receiving his primary or secondary schooling in French</li>
</ul>
<p>Children whose parents or siblings do not meet at least one the above criteria are not eligible
for the program even if the parents have learned French as a second language and are
considered bilingual. Exceptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Students in the francophone program should be exposed regularly to French within the home.</p>
<p>Students in the four-day francophone program must additionally be at least 4 years old by
December 31 of the school year in which they are registered.</p>
