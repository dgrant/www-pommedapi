<h1 id="the-executive-board">The Executive Board</h1>
<p>Pomme d’Api is governed by the constitution of the Pomme d’Api Society which is presided
over by the Executive Board. Board positions are filled by election, and are held by parent
volunteers whose children are enrolled at Pomme d’Api.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The Executive Board consists of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and several
Directors as determined by the Society’s members at the start of each year.</p>
<p>Board members are voted in at the AGM in September. If two people vie for one position, one
may be elected at the AGM, or a compromise may be reached in which two people share a
single Board position.</p>
<p>The Board should ideally include both new and returning parents, to help with continuity and
the transfer of past experience.</p>
<h2 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Board has the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>the administration of the preschool</li>
<li>the policies of the preschool</li>
<li>the finances of the preschool (with the help of a hired accountant)</li>
<li>the staffing of the preschool</li>
<li>organization of the AGM and spring parent meeting</li>
</ul>
<div class="infoBox">
The teachers report to the Board. However, any concerns regarding teachers must
be raised with the President or Vice President in a confidential meeting, not a Board meeting.
</div>

<p>The Board is legally responsible for the preschool, and must file all legal and related documents.</p>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>The Board meets monthly to discuss all issues that concern the preschool. Parents who would
like to address the Board can do so by advising the Secretary that they would like an item to be
added to the agenda, and stating the nature of their concern.</p>
<p>Non-Board members who address the Board may be asked to leave the meeting after their
address is finished if the Board has sensitive issues to discuss.</p>
<p>Board meetings are summarized in the minutes and are distributed to all parents, teachers, and
the accountant. Any discussions that are sensitive in nature will not be detailed in the minutes;
however, it will be noted that the Board did discuss sensitive issues, without giving further
detail.</p>
