<p>For many children, their first year at Pomme d’Api is their first experience in a group setting and in a structured environment away from home. Few of these children have been exposed to the French language and fewer have francophone support at home.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the program, we usually have a mix of 2 ½ to 3 ½ year olds. The first three months of the program (and through the rest of the year), we will work on bringing a harmonious atmosphere in the classroom, working on separation anxiety, problem solving, respect for one another (sharing, taking turns, cleaning after oneself etc...), and following routines. This is done through a cooperative play environment.</p>
<p>Children develop as a whole, and our purpose is to help your child thrive in all areas. Our first goal is to make the children feel at ease in the classroom by respecting their individual levels of development. As with many other preschools or daycares, the focus and challenges are first on developing the child&#39;s social skills and ability to cope with situations typical of a group setting.</p>
<p>French Language in the First Year 
A natural introduction to French is the key to the child’s success, instead of forcing the language unnaturally. We introduce French through the use of repetition of phrases and expressions during our routines. From the start we sing our transitions in French, and French songs will be sung at circle times over and over again. It is important to know that we do not speak 100% French to your child from the start (as opposed to the Programme Francophone, which is entirely in French). We want the child to feel comfortable, and understood at school. French is presented as a fun and safe activity, sparking curiosity and interest in the child.</p>
<p>As the school year progresses English is slowly replaced by French, so that at the end of the first year, your child will have been increasingly exposed to the basic French basic concepts and simple sentences. Most of all, we hope to have helped your child develop the necessary social and motor skills he will need later to be able to learn the language.</p>
<h2 id="second-year">Second Year</h2>
<h3 id="three-day-class-m-w-f-9-15-11-45-am">Three Day Class: M/W/F,  9:15 – 11:45 am</h3>
<p>In their second year at Pomme d’Api, children continuing from the first year programme will know their teachers and most of their friends. They are familiar with the activities and routines at Pomme d&#39;Api. Most importantly, their level of development has taken a big step within a year. At 4 years old, their language is rich, their imagination sparkling, and their attention span lasts much longer. They are eager to learn, and to discover new things!</p>
<p>While we continue to develop social skills, we encourage your child to complete some &quot;work&quot;, focusing on fine motor skills, and activities that will develop premath, pre-reading, pre-writing and logic. We help the child become more independent and we help him develop a sense of self by supporting his creativity, and self-expression while gently guiding him through acceptable social behavior.</p>
<p>French Language In the Second Year 
This year, French in the classroom will be used more often and more casually, to aid in the development of vocabulary and speech in French. More vocabulary will be introduced during circle time and during class time. We will repeat in French what children say in English, so that they continue to learn in a casual, natural way. At this age, children typically have a better understanding and interest in the language.</p>
<p>We introduce the &quot;programme de francisation&quot; Paul et Suzanne. This program is also offered in the Francophone program, to develop proper syntax and concepts of the language. By the end of the second year, children are able to follow classroom directions in French, to understand short stories, and to speak French vocabulary when asked.</p>
<p><strong>At Pomme d’Api, we aim to provide a happy &amp; fun environment through which children can explore and learn. If you have any more questions or wish to set up an appointment to visit the school, please do not hesitate to contact the Registrar at (604) 800-1197.</strong></p>
